# Deep_learning_for_Surgical_Tumor_Detection
Developed an AI-driven diagnostic tool that processes MRI/CT scans using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect tumors and abnormalities with high accuracy.

Implemented image preprocessing pipelines with OpenCV and deployed the model as a real-time inference API using FastAPI on GCP.

Impact: Assists surgeons in pre-operative planning by identifying critical regions, potentially improving surgical outcomes and patient survival rates.
